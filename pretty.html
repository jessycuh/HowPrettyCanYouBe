        <p>As the days go by, you begin to feel disconnected from your new life. The constant attention, flattery, and offers leave you feeling empty. You notice how shallow your interactions with others are—people who once ignored or ridiculed you now act like your best friends, but only because of your looks. The friends you had before seem distant, replaced by a crowd more interested in trends than true connection.</p>
        <p>One afternoon, after another day filled with fake smiles and meaningless compliments, you lock yourself in your room. You stare at your reflection in the mirror, no longer recognizing the person staring back. Beneath the designer clothes and perfect makeup, you feel more isolated than ever.</p>
